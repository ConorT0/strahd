## Full story
### Story
Arc Ebmos the tiefling was born to two very successful noble human wizards in the city of Waterdeep. As a child, his parents pushed him to pursue refined past times, and he learned dragonchess and dance.

Now college aged, his parents have sent him to Cocobolo academy. This is one of the most prestigious and expensive schools in the city. (Read: they wanted the tiefling out of the house, they are taboo to have around. But he would never pick up on that). Arc maintains that it is a complete coincidence that his entrance exam was found to have errors and re-issued after his parents made an extremely generous contribution to the academy. He was a passable student. While on a study abroad, he met the Lost Mines party, and made an enemy in Valrora Autumnwish. He never studied and took shortcuts whenever he could. 

This caught up to him when a ritual he was practicing exploded overnight, destroying an entire classroom full of expensive reagents. Arc will tell anyone that will listen that all evidence of _whoever_ poorly prepared the ritual was lost in the blast. He never denies it was him, but redirects blame. It was someone else, it was the faulty reagents, the supplies should have been in a separate room. Upon seeing the bill of 100,000 gold pieces, his parents decided to teach him a lesson and make him gather the funds himself. He believes this will take “A week or two”. He is wrong. 

Arc wants to graduate so he can follow his family line of Cocobolo wizards. He wants to learn what his parents work on, the Mendes project.
### Personality 
Arc stands at an imposing 5 foot 4 inches, and weighs a hefty 122 pounds. He is fully aware of the fact that he is quite weak physically, and prefers to solve his problems by throwing money around, or thinking around corners. Usually both. Although he has been relegated to just his mind lately as he has been finding his wallet quite light.

He is very self centered, and sheltered from the world outside of his little pocket of the rich part of waterdeep.

### For the DM / deep state connection
Arc's parents (Alam and unnamed mother) made a deal with a devil for their success. The price was a tiefling as their first born. They must raise him, but do not love him. They resent what he is.

They are in with the Waterdeep municipality, which is pretty much dnd illuminati. His parents work counterintelligence for Waterdeep, and they left a letter lying around they should not have which he gleamed secrets from. (Up to you, this was stuff i was gonna use but didn't for my campaign)
- The municipality has been researching other planes of existence (Menands project).
- Most of these planes are empty. 
- Far and away the most interesting one they found was simply named Soot.
- See below. This was a letter sent between two BBEGs, who have plants in the municipality. Arc's parents are investigating them.

Good evening Fane,

The Menands project has finally bore fruit.  We uncovered an address to a realm of soot and insanity containing something suitable for our needs. 

The denizens of the realm were genius artificers. They drove all their genius in to creating artifacts of war, each one made to counter the last. The earthmovers are their final creation. Each one is as tall as a mountain, and able to deflect any blow directed at it. It was created to level cities, and it nearly drove their realm to extinction. A scant few survive on the backs of their own artifice, helpless to the will of their own creation as it stomps around the ashes of their world and wages an endless final war. They say they made another, a counter to the earthmover to save them from their own hell, but could only create two prototypes. Not nearly enough to purge their entire planet of the earthmovers.

We came to them, a bolt from the blue. They were receptive to any deal we struck with them. Anything to get them off of their doomed world, entirely of their own creation. I had my contacts at Waterdeep collect some schematics from the Municipality vault. Based on the specifications of the schematics, they should be powerful enough to pull over something that large. Be careful opening them, they love their cloudkill. Do not worry about the power source, Grace was overjoyed to create one for me. 

May luck be with you,
Xanathar
