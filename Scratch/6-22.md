I finally got around to going to that tavern, and met a bunch of other people who had cards like mine. We slept, and woke up in a spooky forest. We lost a bunch of our shit, anything that was not on my person. I had like 100 gold worth of soaps, and now I am down to just my pajamas. Embarrassing. 

I tried to go back for my stuff, but just walked back around. I think the forest is non-Euclidean. We found a letter that said this whole place is pretty much a quarantine zone for some vampires. I sense a business opportunity, the letter also said the land was quite rich.

A few kids asked us to help them, their house was haunted with a monster in the basement. My companions just busted in, completely rude.  The whole place looks like it was abandoned recently. Fires still going, food on the table.  I borrowed a cloak and hat from the closet, I am sure the Lord of the house wont mind. I was cold.

My companions went about eating their prepared dinner and smoking their tobacco, completely uncouth. We also took down a sword from above the fireplace, seeing as Malaghrys lost his when we woke up in the forest.
